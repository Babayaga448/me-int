# me-int
Personality powered NFTs
Me-int is an experimental NFT collection deployed on the Monad Testnet as part of Monad Dev Mission 5.

ME-int is a personality-based NFT quiz that lets users mint a unique NFT that reflects their psychological archetype.
- A collection of 3125 possible personality combos
- Each NFT is generated from a quiz â€” not randomly, but personally
- Only you can mint the NFT assigned to your combo
- One mint per wallet, free and bot-resistant

Project Goals
- Explore how personalization can impact the sentimental value of NFTs  
- Demonstrate that NFT mints donâ€™t always have to be public or botted  
- Build a fun, identity-driven minting experience

How It Works
1. Connect your wallet (only on Monad Testnet)
2. Take a 5-question personality quiz
3. Your answer combo (like `ACDBE`) determines which NFT you're eligible to mint
4. See a preview of your generated NFT
5. Mint it and that combo is now locked forever for you

Anti-Bot Logic
- No public mint button
- NFT only mints after a quiz is completed
- Each personality combo can only be minted once
- 1 mint per wallet

Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Smart Contract: ERC721A (optimized for gas), deployed on Monad Testnet

Future Ideas
- Allow NFT holders to "level up" or evolve their archetype
- Introduce sentiment-based onchain traits or social badges
- Add peer-to-peer trading or quiz rematches
